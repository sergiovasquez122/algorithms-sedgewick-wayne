4.1.1 What is the maximum number of edges in a graph with V vertices and no parallel edges?
What is the minimum number of edges in a graph with V vertices, none of which are isolated?
V * (V-1) / 2 and V - 1

4.1.14 Suppose you use a stack instead of a queue when running breadth-first search. Does it still compute shortest paths.
No we show this with a counter-example. Suppose the undirected
graph given below.

1 - 2
 \ /
  0 (source)

A breadth-first search would produce distances of integer value 1
for both vertices 1 and 2. A dfs solution would produce one vertex of
distance 1 and another of distance 2. This shows that dfs is not guaranteed to compute
the shortest path in a graph.
