4.1.2 Draw, in the style of the figure in the text, the adjacency lists built by Graph's input
stream constructor for the files tinyGex2.txt

0 -> [6, 2, 5]
1 -> [11, 4, 8]
2 -> [0, 6, 3, 5]
3 -> [10, 2, 6]
4 -> [8, 1]

4.1.6 Consider the four-vertex graph with edges 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, and 3-0. Drawn an array of adjacency-list that could not
have been built calling addEdge() for these edges no matter what order.
0 -> [1, 3]
1 -> [2, 0]
2 -> [3, 1]
3 -> [0, 2]

4.1.12 what does the BFS tree tell us about the distance from v to w when neither is at the root?

If both of the vertices are on different branches then it tells use there is path
of length distTo[v] + distTo[w] to get from u to v. where the distTo array tells the
distance of a vertex to the root. if they are on the same brance then the
distance from v to w is the abs(dist[v] - dist[w]).

4.1.14 Suppose you use a stack instead of a queue when running breadth-first search. Does it still compute shortest paths.

No we show this with a counter-example. Suppose the undirected
graph given below.

1 - 2
 \ /
  0 (source)

A breadth-first search would produce distances of integer value 1
for both vertices 1 and 2. A dfs solution would produce one vertex of
distance 1 and another of distance 2. This shows that dfs is not guaranteed to compute
the shortest path in a graph.

4.1.9 Show, in the style of figure on page 533, a detailed trace of the call dfs(0) for the
the graph built by the Graph's input stream constructor for the file tinyGex2.txt.
Also, draw the tree represented by edgeTo[].

4.1.12 Prove that every connected graph has a vertex who removal
will not disconnect the graph, and write a graph a dfs method that
finds such a vertex.

trying the proof using induction
We prove this by strong induction. Let P(n) be that any connected graph with n vertices
has at least two vertices such that the their removal would not disconnect the graph where n>=2
The base case P(2) holds.
Assume it holds for P(2), ... , P(n), we show then that is must also hold for P(n + 1).
Let G be a graph with n + 1 vertices. Suppose that the graph has no
vertex such that it removal would disconnect the graph, then we're done.
else suppose that there is a vertex v that separate the graph in two at least two
connected components G1 and G2. WLOG suppose G1 has only one vertex then
it had degree one in the original graph G and hence could be removed without
disconnecting the graph G. else if G1 has more than one vertex
then by IHOP it has at least two edges u1 and u2 such that their removal
would not disconnect the graph. if any those two edges do not disconnect G then we're done.
suppose that u1 disconnect G then it must be the only neighbor of v or
else v would disconnect G1 - u1 to the rest of the graph. so u2 doesn't connect G as v
is connected to G1 - u2 through u1. A similar argument can be used to G2. hence we conclude Graph with
at least 2 vertices must have at least two vertices that do not disconnect the
graph.

trying the proof more alongside an algorithm

Since the graph is connected there is a path from
every vertex to every other vertex. we construct a labeling ordering of
v1,v2 .. vn. WLOG We compute the dfs tree rooted at vertex v1. the dfs tree must contain
every vertex in the graph since the graph is connected. We note then that any leaf in the tree would
be a candidate for removal in the graph G. to see this we note that ny leaf node has the property
that every vertex adjacent to it has already been visited since if it hadn't the current vertex would not have
been a leaf node. removing this vertex alongside all of its edges would not disconnect the graph.

connected components in the graph built by Graph's input stream constructor for the file
